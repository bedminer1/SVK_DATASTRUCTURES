# SVK_DATASTRUCTURES

A little backstory:

This repo started off as just a part of The Odin Project's introduction to data structures. 

But one day, after a chat with an aspiring game dev friend where he asked 'what's the point of leetcode, I won't use data structures and algorithms anyways?' and me failing to explain it, the idea for this project spawned, aiming to explain what are some common data structures and how they could be 
implemented and applied in many use cases.
