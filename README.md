# SVK_DATASTRUCTURES

About:
This repo started off as just a part of The Odin Project's introduction to data structures. However, after a chat with an aspiring game dev friend where he asked 'what's the point of leetcode, I won't use data structures and algorithms anyways?' 
Instinctively, I tried explaining using just words but it didn't quite stick. So this is a project dedicated to explaining what are data structures and as a small tutorial on how they could be 
implemented and applied in many things.
